## A Breif History of C++

C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979, after modifying an older coding language, C, so that it would be better for program organization. C++ is an ideal language for operating systems, because it is a strong language that is easy and fast to code in. It has been used to make Windows, Microsoft Office, Unreal Engine, and Google Chrome

## Getting Started

C++ can be difficult to work with on Windows computers. Although some recomend Visual Code Studios, I've found that the standard Visual Studio works best. It's fairly easy to download and, although it may seem daunting to manuever, there are plenty of resources online describing how to get Visual Studio to work for you. 
Since C++ is a Static language, we'll need to compile the code first before running it. The keyboard command to do this is CTRL + SHIFT + B. Then to actually run the code, you'll do the command ALT + F11 (or ALT + FN + F11 if you're working on a keyboard withere the F keys have multiple uses).
